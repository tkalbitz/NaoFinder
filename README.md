# NaoFinder

## About

NaoFinder is an example implementation of the infocast protocol which provides
basic information about the current robots in the network.  Infocast can be
found here: https://github.com/tkalbitz/infocast .  

NaoFinder receives infocast packages, parses them and shows the robot status in a
QT4 GUI. It displays all information about the robot. Functionality which is not 
implemented is the usage of the text to speech capabilities of the robot.
